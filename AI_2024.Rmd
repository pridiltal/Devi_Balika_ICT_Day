**John McCarthy coined the term "artificial intelligence" in 1956 when he organized the Dartmouth Conference.**

<!--which is considered the birth of AI as a field, the man who organized the conference where AI was born

1956. John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon coined the term artificial intelligence in a proposal for a workshop widely recognized as a founding event in the AI field-->

## Origin of Statistics

- The term statistics is derived from
     - **"status"**  - political state   (Latin )
     - **"statista"**  - statesman or politician    (Italian)
     
--

- Original idea of **"statistics"** was restricted to information about states 

--

- Later extended to include all collections of information of all types

--

- In modern terms, **"statistics"** means both 
   - sets of collected information  
   - analytical work which requires statistical inference

## Timeline of machine learning

- **<1950s**:	Statistical methods are discovered and refined.
--

- **1950s**: Pioneering ML research is conducted using simple algorithms.
--

- **1960s**:	Bayesian methods are introduced for probabilistic inference in ML
--

- **1970s**:	'AI Winter' caused by pessimism about ML effectiveness.
--

- **1980s**: Rediscovery of backpropagation causes a recovery in ML research
--

- **1990s**:	Work on ML shifts from a knowledge-driven approach to a data-driven approach. 
--

- **2000s**:	Support Vector Clustering and other Kernel methods  and unsupervised ML methods become widespread.
--

- **2010s**	Deep learning becomes feasible, which leads to machine learning becoming 	essential, to many widely used software services and applications.

# GDPR rule

- The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25, 2018.
--

- GDPR Articles 13-15 and 21-22 outline requirements related to automated data processing and decision making. 
--

- The basic concept is that when a decision is generated solely from automated processing (no human intervention), including profiling, the data subject has the right to receive an explanation of how the decision was rendered.
--

- Automated data processing and decision systems typically use machine learning
--

- The problem with many state-of-the-art models is a lack of transparency and interpretability (Hard to explain internal logic and inner workings) 

---
<!--
- When it comes to AI, "explanation" could mean several things:

1) How an algorithm works or how the system functions.
      
2) The factors or data that resulted in a decision by the algorithm or system that impacted an individual (a data subject).
-->

- There are projects that aim to produce explainable AI such as the DARPA Explainable AI (XAI) program and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME).

- Anomalies in data can be considered data flaws or measurement errors that can lead to biased parameter estimation, model misspecification and misleading results if classical analysis techniques are blindly applied.

<!--One downgrades the value of anomalies and attempts eliminating them,

n such situations, the focus is to find opportunities to remove anomalous points and thereby improve both the quality of the data and results from the subsequent data analysis-->

<!--In contrast, in many other applications-->

- Anomalies themselves are the main carriers of significant and often critical information that can cause significant harm to valuable lives and assets if not detected and treated quickly.

- Water quality sensors are exposed to changing environments and extreme weather conditions

- Two types of anomalies:
  - Water quality breaches associated with real events
  - Technical issues in the sensor equipment (low battery power, biofouling of the probes, errors in calibration, rust, sensor maintenance activities etc.)

# Recap

- Statistics is  not relevant to me or my future.
- Statistics is only for coursework.
- Statistics is only for "genius mathematician".
- Statistics hasn't changed much in years. It's just the same old stuff.
- We now have AI and Machine Learning so don't need statistics anymore.
- A statistician's work can be replaced by a computer, because it is all about performing certain numerical calculations.
- All Research is "wet Lab" research.
- There is a "right" answer in research.
- Outliers are not important and can be completely ignored.
- Statisticians are boring and unsociable.
- If a person knows probability theory, he/she can become a millionaire by participating in lotteries.

- Statistics is  <span style="color: red;">**very**</span> relevant to me and my future.
- There are so many applications in Statistics
- Statistics is for <span style="color: red;"> everyone</span>.
- Statistics is a very rich tree that we haven't explored fully yet.
-  Statistics plays a vital role in AI and ML.
-  Data Scientist and statistician are. consistently ranked as best jobs in the world
- A lot of research out there is NOT "Wet lab" research.
- Being a statistician is like being a detective and trying to understand the story the data is trying to tell you.
- Outliers demands special attention and sometime they are the main carriers of significant and often critical information.
- Research provides a thrill of discovery and a challenge to then communicate those insights to others.

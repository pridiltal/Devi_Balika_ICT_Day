# Strong AI 

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), General AI

## Has the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a <span style="color:blue"> wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence </span>.

<!--
## AI systems that possess  <span style="color:blue">human-like cognitive abilities </span> to understand, learn, and perform tasks across diverse domains autonomously.
-->

<!--#### - Hypothetical future state of artificial intelligence

<!--
As of now, true examples of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) do not exist

AGI represents a hypothetical future state of artificial intelligence where machines possess human-like cognitive abilities, such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving, across a broad range of tasks and domains


In "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" (2001), the concept of General AI is explored through the character of David, a highly advanced robotic boy programmed to experience emotions and love. While the film primarily focuses on David's journey and his desire to become human, his capabilities and experiences offer glimpses into the concept of General AI.

David is designed to possess the ability to love and form emotional connections, which goes beyond the typical functions of AI seen in the film's world. He demonstrates the capacity to learn, adapt, and experience complex emotions such as longing, joy, and sorrow. Throughout the film, David's interactions with humans and other AI characters challenge the boundaries between artificial and human intelligence, raising questions about consciousness, identity, and the nature of humanity.-->
